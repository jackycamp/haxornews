# Haxornews

Don't you want to feel like a hackermans when reading Hacker News stories? Of course you do!

## Another Hacker News reader? But why?

Well, might I say, you make a valid point. But like... why not?
Jokes aside, I just wanted to make a reader that had that Haxor vibe. Moreover, for most readers that I've used, when you select a story, it brings up a new window with the story url, I'd rather have the option to make it appear in a smaller window that I could quickly glance at to see if I want to keep reading or not. Additionally, I'd like to quickly build up a queue of 'saved' stories that I could come back to. Oh, and of course, I also wanted to mess around with Hacker News' public api.

## Disclaimer, Haxornews is under active development, with releases/patches rolling out often
Upcoming features:
- Access to all top stories (not just the top 20)
- Access to 'Jobs'
- Access to 'New'
- Access to 'Best'
- Save for later queue
