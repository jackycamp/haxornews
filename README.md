### [See Haxornews in action](https://jakuzo.github.io/haxornews/ "Haxornews")

**Yet another Hackernews reader. Built with React.**

### **But why?**
Why not?? Also just wanted to mess around with their api.

### Disclaimer, Haxornews is under active development, with releases/patches rolling out __randomly__
Planned features:
- Access to all top stories (not just the top 20)
- Access to 'Jobs'
- Access to 'New'
- Access to 'Best'
- Save for later queue
